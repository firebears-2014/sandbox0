#Power Drink

* 3 charged D batteries
* 1 Military grade blast wall
* 23 premium steaks
* 1 gallon pulp free orange juice
* 1 tsp pure energy
* 2 tbsp powdered bagels
* 3 cups green pepper
* 1/2 gallon unsalted grease (melted)
* 16 uncharged D batteries
* .001 oz dark/anti matter (I would suggest Walmart brand)

Combine dark matter, grease, pure energy, and 7 steaks into large container after setting up blast wall. Stir until pure energy and steak have dissolved. Then mix in powdered bagels and charged batteries, along with orange juice. Finally, wrap each battery in steak and place on grate. Roast the 16 D batteries over boiling orange juice for 48 hours or until batteries begin to catch fire or explode.

Let drink sit at least 5 minutes before consuming.
